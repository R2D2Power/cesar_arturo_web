                                I wouldn't say that I specialize in a specific programming language; instead, I specialize in thoroughly researching specific topics, learning quickly, and finding effective solutions. I consider myself multidisciplinary. Despite my background in mechatronic engineering, which encompasses knowledge of mechanics, electronics, robotics, and control systems, I have chosen to specialize in software development. I apply the techniques I've developed to leverage my existing knowledge and achieve various objectives.

                                            My bachelor thesis involved 
                                            developing a voice-user 
                                            interface (VUI) for robotics, 
                                            incorporating cutting-edge 
                                            technologies at the time.

                                            <p>
                                            I created an Amazon Alexa Skill 
                                            to receive and identify control 
                                            commands sent to a microcontroller 
                                            through an MQTT Broker.

                                            <p>
                                            I used an ESP32 Microcontroller 
                                            connected to the same MQTT broker 
                                            as the Alexa Skill. Additionally, 
                                            I implemented the DYNAMIXEL 
                                            Protocol 1.0 communication protocol 
                                            within the controller. Due to 
                                            limited materials and resources, 
                                            it served as both a bridge and a 
                                            driver for remote control of the 
                                            robot.
                                            </p>
                                            <p>
                                            I programmed the CM-530 controller 
                                            for the Robotis humanoid robot 
                                            educational kit using the RoboPlus 
                                            Task Program platform, which is 
                                            software for programming Robotis 
                                            robots. The program involved 
                                            reading commands sent from the 
                                            ESP32 controller using the 
                                            DYNAMIXEL Protocol 1.0. This 
                                            allowed numerical data to be 
                                            sent and processed in the CM-530 
                                            controller as action commands, 
                                            originating from the Amazon Alexa 
                                            Skill and creating a functional 
                                            voice interface for the robotic
